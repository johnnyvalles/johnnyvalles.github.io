<p>I'm a fourth-year computer science student at the University of California, Irvine. 
I created this site to serve as my portfolio and as an outlet for my technical writing skills. 
In the Articles page, you'll find a collection of computer science articles/tutorials 
written by me. Feel free to have a look or get in contact with me!</p>
