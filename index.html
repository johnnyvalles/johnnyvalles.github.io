<h2>{{ "whoami?" | upcase }}</h2>
<p>I'm a fourth year computer science student at the University of California, Irvine.
I created this site mainly to serve as my portfolio and blog. The blog houses a variety of articles
about computer science (e.g. tutorials, data structures, databases, etc). The purpose of the blog is to provide computer science tutorials and to showcase my technical writing skills. Feel free to have a look or get in contact with me!</p>
